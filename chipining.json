We need to understand and comply to the surrounding factors on why these things happened.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was in my elementary, some of my classmates are bringing all their favourite toys. There was one who really brought his entire collection of toy cars, big and small. I was fascinated to his little muscled cars - it really looked amazing! Sadly, I wasn't able to go nearer to that boy because a horde of other boys in the class went rushing in to see and play. In that moment, I really felt that they are more ahead from me, I felt the feeling of having nothing, and that in life there are different levels and classes of people. \r\n\r\nWhen I went back home, it's quite funny, I really asked my mother - \"Ma, are we rich?\". My mom just laughed at me. Sadly, it was a sure confirmation that we really aren't. We all lived a simple life, we eat three times in a day, we are in the grey area between poverty and the lower-middle class families. My mom is a plain housewife and my father is true blue proletariat - a pure working-class.\r\n\r\nI was in my bedtime hours, but my thought cannot get over of that little muscled cars. Even in the morning when I woke up, up until school hours. One afternoon when I was heading home, I came to pass by this posh, high-end shop in our city. There, I saw a shiny little thing, inside a box, so gorgeous - a matchbox car. I was salivating, then I saw the price sticked outside. It is worth three days of our family meal. I just turned around and headed home. I realised that my parents can't afford to buy one for me, I just kept it to myself. Also, I did not dare to ask for it from my parents. In the contrary, my parents have gifted me things that I really need, like shirts, shoes, bags, and anything for my school. But not the luxurious ones. In a greater scheme of things, in that early stage, my parents have taught me to identify the 'needs' from the 'wants'.\r\n\r\nMaybe it has taught me in the subtlest way. In my grown-up years, life has been tougher each day. Everything sank in, that I really need to work hard for something to achieve it. During that years, I can't remember anyone even from my family who gifted me or bought a pair of shoes, jeans, or anything for me. I saved from those extra pennies left from my daily allowance, sometimes, I did not eat or buy something in our school canteen. In summer, I really joined in our city's jobs programme for students, and that was the time that I can buy for myself. Really hard, it was really tough. But self-fulfilling, in that way, I helped my parents to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nNow back to that little muscled car. I really just can't afford it. But it has taught me a lesson not to give up on your dreams, that there are times you are down and in the losing end, but you need to get up and work hard. There is always tomorrow. You are maybe not in the right track today, but hope fuels us to walk with little steps. Gradually, you are getting the hang of it, and your aim is getting tighter as you stepped more and more. That little constant rhythm will keep you stay on track, sometimes, you can be out of the tempo, but be quick to sync back to the rhythm. We are living in a space-time dimension. There is always a proper place, and a proper time for everything. Learn to wait while doing something.", "created_date": "2016-11-11T20:27:20.573Z", "published_date": "2016-11-11T20:34:00.208Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 12, "fields": {"author": 1, "title": "Is There Any Difference?", "image": "./holdontyt.jpg", "height_field": 667, "width_field": 1000, "text": "Martial Law in the Philippines has affected the country enormously. Some people may say it has a positive effect, others, specifically on the opposing side will always counter it with negative connotations.\r\n\r\nFor those who really claimed they struggled during the era, Martial Law has become synonymous with torture, oppression, corruption, and social injustice. How was the lives of the people during that time, and how was it compares to the lives of the common Filipinos today? Is there any difference at all? That's the question we need to ponder.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the EDSA People Power. I was just a toddler during that year. While living in the province, we didn't really feel the essence of that so-called revolution. Yes, there were few who sympathise with what was going in the capital, but not that we can say it was a national consensus. Apart from what we saw on the television, those seas of emotions, the singing of  'Magkaisa', 'Handog ng Pilipino...', and the iconic girl giving flowers to a soldier, the lives in a day of a common people in the province was plainly normal. Especially if you are from Mindanao. \r\n\r\nMinus the technologies, the fashion, and the rise of the social media, did we feel any change in our society after EDSA? Those primary actors of the regime, the likes of Fidel Ramos, Juan Ponce Enrile, and other personalities, how are they now? Fidel Ramos was the chief of the Philippine Constabulary, Enrile was the national defence secretary. After the regime, there were countless investigation happened but was there an investigation against the personalities mentioned above? Surprisingly, Ramos was elected to Presidency and Enrile enjoyed more terms as a Senator.\r\n\r\nIn the area of Philippine business, we can notice the same families, faces, and conglomerates. They are still controlling and running the joint. From the Marcos up until now, they are getting more richer while the majority of the Filipinos are still poor. Such a cliche, right? But that is a hard fact.\r\n\r\nIn the recent weeks, and particularly yesterday, the social media, the news, and the opposing camps are ringing loudly. The sending-off of the late dictator and the secret burial in the LNMB (Libingan ng Mga Bayani) really struck the Aquinos and their supporters wildly. They don't want a plunderer, dictator, and a killer to be buried in that (they may say) sacred place. \r\n\r\nFor me, what it is about the dead compares to the majority of the living Filipinos who are living in unfavourable conditions, deprived of education, food, shelter, jobs, and security. If the past has made us miserable, why we keep dwelling in that place? Can we move out and move on for a better future? We cannot deny the atrocities of the Marcos regime, but we cannot also deny the problems that we are still facing. Like the drug problems, the narco-politics, the corruption, the on-going rebellion, joblessness, and poverty. What we need now is unity. Again, cliche may it sounds, but again, that's a hard fact.
